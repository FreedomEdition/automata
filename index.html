                        <h1>Cherry Tomatoes</h1>
                        <p>Cherry tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme) are fairly quick and easy to grow even if you are new to gardening. 
                            They need fewer days to mature than regular tomatoes. 
                            This is a big advantage if you live in a cold climate where the growing season is short or if the temperatures in your zone heat up too fast for the fruit to set during the summer.

                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Light</p>
                        <p>Plenty of sunlight is crucial to successfully grow cherry tomatoes. 
                            They need full, direct sun for at least six to eight hours per day.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Soil</p>
                        <p>The soil for tomatoes needs to be slightly acidic, well-drained, rich, and loamy. 
                            Do a soil test to determine the nutrient level in your soil and its pH.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Water</p>
                        <p>Tomatoes must be watered deeply and regularly. 
                            At no time should you let the soil dry out. 
                            During the time of fruit development, keeping the soil evenly moist helps to prevent blossom end rot. 
                            On the other hand, overwatering can cause the tomatoes to split. 
                            Drip irrigation is best, as overhead watering can lead to the spread of tomato diseases, such as blight.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Temperature and Humidity</p>
                        <p>Tomatoes must be watered deeply and regularly. 
                            Tomatoes are highly cold-sensitive. 
                            Wait until the soil temperature has reached at least 60 degrees Fahrenheit before planting. 
                            And make sure to harden off seedlings started indoors by gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions before planting them in the garden.

                            Humidity generally isn't an issue for tomatoes. 
                            But one factor to keep in mind is humid weather can cause the foliage to stay wetter longer. 
                            This can create a prime climate for fungal issues and other diseases, especially if there isn't good air flow around the plants.

                        <h1>Roma Tomatoes</h1>
                        <p>Roma refers to a group of tomato varieties that are the prime choice for sauces and canning. 
                            They have less moisture content than other, juicier tomato varieties such as beefsteak tomatoes. 
                            Romas have a thick fruit wall and skin, firm and dense flesh, and they have fewer seeds. 
                            These properties make them an ideal tomato type for cooking down, which has also earned them the name paste tomatoes.

                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Light</p>
                        <p>Roma tomatoes need full sun, which means a minimum of six to eight hours of direct sunlight. 
                            Anything less will result in leggy plants and poor fruit.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Soil</p>
                        <p>Tomatoes grow best in deep, loamy, well-drained, rich soil that is slightly acidic (pH between 6.2 and 6.8). 
                            Before planting, amend the soil with organic matter.

                            For yards with heavy clay soil, it is best to grow tomatoes in raised beds filled with suitable soil.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Water</p>
                        <p>Tomatoes needs to be well-watered at all times so you need to keep an eye on the soil moisture level all season long. 
                            In the absence of rain, give them at least 1 to 1.5 inches of water per week. 
                            The soil should never dry out, which can lead to fast wilting. 
                            Water slowly and deeply and try not to get the foliage wet, which increases the risk of spreading fungal diseases such as blight.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Temperature and Humidity</p>
                        <p>Romas need warm temperatures, so if you live in a cold climate with a short growing season, pick the quickest maturing varieties. 
                            In the spring, delay planting until nighttime temperatures reach at least 60 degrees. 

                            Tomatoes can withstand humid conditions but high humidity can foster the spread of diseases, especially if there is a lack of air circulation within the plant, and between plants.

                        <p>Beefsteak tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) are meaty, juicy fruits perfect for summer sandwiches or as sliced snacks with a sprinkle of sea salt. 
                            Large, thickly fleshed beefsteaks are the biggest type of tomatoes, weighing 1 pound or more. 
                            Growing quickly to at least 6 feet tall, the late-maturing tomato plant will produce a bountiful harvest in about 85 days. 
                            It needs a sturdy cage, trellis, or stake to support its fruit.

                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Light</p>
                        <p>Give beefsteak tomatoes full, direct sunlight 8 hours or more per day. 
                            Make sure no shadows are cast by nearby buildings or trees. 
                            For best results, grow them on a slight slope with southern or southeastern exposure. 
                            A well-drained raised garden bed is especially good in cooler climates because it will warm early in the season.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Soil</p>
                        <p>As for all tomato plants, provide beefsteaks with well-drained fertile soil that is high in organic matter. 
                            Fertile clay and loam produce high yields, while lighter soils drain and warm quickly and will produce earlier harvests. 
                            Maintain a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. 
                            Keep the bed weeded, and mulch between rows of tomatoes to prevent weed overgrowth and to conserve moisture. 
                            Black plastic mulch will warm the soil and radiate heat.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Water</p>
                        <p>After planting, water immediately to moisten and settle the soil. 
                            Throughout the growing season, keep tomatoes consistently watered, especially as they begin to fruit. 
                            Moisture will prevent fruits from cracking and encourage deep rooting. 
                            If it rains less than one inch in a week, be sure to water them well. 
                            They will need one to two inches of water weekly. 
                            Never let the foliage begin to wilt.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Temperature and Humidity</p>
                        <p>Plant tomatoes when temperatures are above 55 degrees Fahrenheit or ideally above 60 degrees. 
                            Since they are warm-weather crops, even a light frost can damage plants. 
                            In the event of a potential frost or temperature dip, cover the plants with a frost blanket.

                        <h1>Plumper Heirloom Tomatoes</h1>
                        <p>Heirloom tomatoes are annual plants that have not been crossbred or hybridized for at least 40 years. 
                            They are open-pollinated, meaning the seeds will produce plants identical to the parent plant. 
                            Growing heirloom tomatoes with saved seeds means you will grow the same tomatoes the next year. 
                            Like the many hybrids, heirlooms can be easy to grow; the plants are fast-growing when planted in the spring, but they need 60 to 80 days or more to produce ripe fruit.

                        <h4>How to care for Heirloom tomatoes?</h4>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Light</p>
                        <p>When it comes to sunlight, heirloom tomatoes are one of the hungriest plants out there, along with plants like sunflowers or corn. 
                            They need full, direct, unfiltered sunlight all day long. 
                            Pay attention to any shadows cast by neighboring trees or buildings when you plan your tomato patch.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Soil</p>
                        <p>Healthy soil is critical for thriving heirloom tomato plants. 
                            They will yield the greatest harvest in rich, slightly acidic (pH 6.0-6.8), loamy soil that allows roots to penetrate deeply.
                            If your soil is heavy clay, use raised beds or container culture. 
                            Add compost, leaf mold, or manure up to fifty percent to blend with the native garden soil.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Water</p>
                        <p>Keeping your tomatoes well-watered is a must, especially once they set fruit. 
                            Watering deeply will encourage deep root systems. 
                            Assuming you did a good job preparing the soil, drainage should be excellent, so keep an eye on the moisture level and never let plants dry out. 
                            Allowing the soil to vacillate between moist and dry causes problems in fruit development, including cracking and blossom end rot. 
                            Use drip irrigation to further limit airborne diseases like blight.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Temperature and Humidity</p>
                        <p>Heirloom tomatoes need warm temperatures to grow. 
                            Planting them too early won't give you earlier fruits; wait until night temperatures are at least 60 degrees Fahrenheit before planting outdoors. 
                            Humid conditions don't typically bother heirloom tomatoes.
                        </p>
